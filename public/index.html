  <div class="about-the-show">
    You are about to enter *a graphic design exhibition.* <span class="read-more read hide-text">read more… </span><span class="full-text hide-text">go ahead, walk into the gallery now. it&rsquo;s a darkened room, not small, and seems to be roughly a cube. On the walls surrounding you are three large-scale projections, each cycling through what appear to be abstract graphics, scanned pages, short movies. what binds these various bits together? well, you check out where the projections are coming from, and you find three projectors standing on pedestals. on each is an identifying label. The first reads, <span class="david">VIS 215, Graphic Design</span>. after what appears to be a room number and building name (one eighty-five nassau street) is a meeting time. you surmise, clever visitor, that what&rsquo;s on the projected loop must be the work of a particular class in this university. in fact it is. this first one is &lsquo;introduction to graphic design&rsquo; and it shows a sequence of scans of letter-sized pieces of paper, the results of a collaborative exercise where twelve students work together in the typography studio to compose (with individual metal letters) a text titled, &lsquo;the crystal goblet, or printing should be invisible.&rsquo; this is the first class assignment &mdash; the second is to set another text, this time &lsquo;the new typography,&rsquo; using a photocopier . . . now, you spin around ninety degrees and find a second pedestal. its label reads, <span class="david">VIS 216, Visual Form</span>. you know the score by now, and you can safely assume this is another graphic design class. this is also an introductory class, but instead of letters, students deal with graphic forms (logos, icons, signs, and so on). three assignments are collected and the first asks students to design a graphic symbol which means &lsquo;stop&rsquo; without resorting to either graphic or linguistic convention. impossible, you say! yes, well they are next asked to design a matching symbol that means the opposite: &lsquo;go.&rsquo; the second assignment is related. these are animated gifs, meant to indicate &lsquo;wait&rsquo; or to show that something is &lsquo;currently in process.&rsquo; these are variations on the well-known and not-loved, spinning beach ball of death that the macintosh shows when the system is busy thinking. the final assignment is more open. students are asked to design a &lsquo;model&rsquo; to understand and communicate the differences between r-g-b (additive) and c-m-y-k (subtractive) color. . . deep breath, now turn around again and look towards the third projection. this one feels largest, and likely because what you see on the wall is a giant apple watch. the pedestal label reads, <span class="david">VIS 415, Advanced Graphic Design</span>. collected here is the work from two semesters of this intensive, workshop class. the assignment is simple, and lasts the full semester &mdash; design a new face for the apple watch which tell the time, and (by design) also changes the way you *read* the time. simple, no? and yet the clock is the one part of this interface off-limits to developers. the students begin by considering, with a broad historical scope, how the representation of time effects the ways we understand it and use it . . . like the time on this giant apple watch, nothing sits still in this gallery. each projection continues marching along, showing one student at a time. it&rsquo;s been seven years since graphic design has been taught at this university and here *now,* in this gallery are the collected works of one hundred eighty-four students who&rsquo;ve studied graphic design at princeton university. <span class="read-less read">read less… </span></span>
